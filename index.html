       <p>
             Hi everyone, my name is Charlie. I'm here to talk to everyone about why I believe I have what it takes to succeed as an emerging professional in year up & in this industry. 
             One reason I believe this is because of my past work experiences. Being in the customer service industry for nearly 10 years has made me accustomed to working solo or in a team, working in a fast paced environment, and the most important, working under pressure. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Over the years, I have not only grown as a person but I have also developed many skills and work ethics. Some of these important skills I have developed are leadership, attention to details big or small, determination, problem solving, and innovation. 
            When presented with the opportunity, I prefer to take leadership roles in my professional life. I feel that it is my duty to step up when others need help, I enjoy being able to lead others to achieve their goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Leadership requires you to take feedback and critically listen to others, which I believe to be an important standard of any business. Listening to a team has helped me develop great problem solving skills. 
            I like to make decisions that honor the greater good rather than just myself. I carry great determination in the tasks and projects that I do, and I rely on my innovative skills to help me carry out these goals. 
            During the process, I make sure to pay special attention to details so that I maximize my time and do things right the first time. These are just some of the main strengths that continue to shape me into a professional in my craft to this day. 
  
        </p>
